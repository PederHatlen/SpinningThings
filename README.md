# Spinning Things (No better way to put it)

My little brother made a concept of something similar with projection and rotation, and i wanted to try aswell.  
I ended up adding the Utah Teapot and Benchy together with the "Boring cube".

I would have written how to change to the other objects, but that's no fun :)

Models used:

- Utah Teapot: [teapot.obj (Stanford university)](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/as3/code/as3/teapot.obj)
- Benchy: [https://github.com/CreativeTools/3DBenchy](https://github.com/CreativeTools/3DBenchy)
